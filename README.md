# RAFT

Raft is an alternative to Apache Kafka written in rust. The name raft comes from the mental image of paddling through indefinite data streams, just trying to get from point A to point B.

The purpose behind this project are as follows:

1. This is a learning experiment for myself. I am trying to dig into the details of rust with a project that interests me.
2. Java is not a memory or cpu efficient language. Therefore, resource encumbered systems have no option to utilize the incredible benefits of Kafka.
3. At-least-once+At-most-once message delivery is a first class citizen.
4. Distributed systems and containerization is the primary user.
5. Have fun
6. Fuck around and find out (I am fucking around to find out)
